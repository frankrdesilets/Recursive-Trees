This is a Java project that was completed for a grade of "A" in the course Intermediate Computer Programming at Austin College, in Spring 2022.
Please see below for details.

•	Implemented GUI using Eclipse IDE and Swing that enables user to configure and generate a tree, with the settings on left and currently generated tree displayed on right
•	Used object-oriented programming to create class hierarchy and different panels of GUI
•	Utilized Swing objects to develop sections and settings on GUI, including JFrame, JPanel, and JButton
•	Used recursive method in the class Tree to draw "branch" segments at progressing coordinates and angles to draw the "tree"
•	Designed and implemented custom feature not in project instructions that enables user to “grow” a tree based on current setting configuration, using a Timer object to generate a tree in increasing stages of “growth”
