This is a Java project that was completed for a grade of "A" in the course Intermediate Computer Programming at Austin College, in Spring 2022.
Please see below for details.

•	Built GUI using Eclipse IDE and Swing that enables user to configure and generate a tree, with the settings on the left and currently generated tree displayed on the right
•	Used object-oriented design to create a class hierarchy and different panels of the GUI
•	Utilized Swing objects to develop sections and settings on GUI, some of which include JFrame, JPanel, and JButton
•	Added a custom feature not in the project instructions that enables the user to “grow” a tree based on the current setting configuration, using a Timer object 
  to generate a tree in increasing stages of “growth”
